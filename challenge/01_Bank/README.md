### Start
Have a look at the `contracts` folder. Each smart contract has comments
starting with `// (!) ... ` that explain what the code should do. The following
`/* ... */` show you where you have to implement something.  

**Happy coding!**

### Testing
Make sure you are connected to the local Ganache network at
https://127.0.0.1:7545

For testing a specific contract run `$ truffle test test/<ContractName>`
For testing all contracts in a section run `$ truffle test`
